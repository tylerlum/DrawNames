# DrawNames

Customize-able Secret Santa Name List Generator

The purpose of this repository is to

1. Assign buyers and receivers for Secret Santa events. The user can specify the number of presents that each buyer should be buying, and the program will ensure that no buyer draws the same name twice.

2. Send emails to all Secret Santa participants telling them who to buy a present for.

3. Draw a Christmas tree and include it in the email for festivity. The Christmas tree is a String of the following characters: `[`, `]`, `=`, `~`. 

__How to Use__: The easiest way to use this code is to use Jupyter Notebook. Then you can customize the email settings and names and then use it!

An example of what the email would look like:
