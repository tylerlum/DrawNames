# Draw Names

Customizable Secret Santa Name List Generator

## Overview

The purpose of this script is to:

* Assign each buyer a list of gift receivers for Secret Santa events. The user can specify the number of presents that each buyer should be buying, and the program will ensure that no buyer draws the same name twice.

* Send emails to all Secret Santa participants telling them who to buy a present for.

* Draw a Christmas tree and include it in the email for festivity. The Christmas tree is a String of the following characters: [, ], =, ~.

To use Draw Names, read the instructions in `Draw_Names.ipynb`.
